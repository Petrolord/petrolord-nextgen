# refinery "Refinery Feasibility & Planning" SEED LADDER, content-addressed.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS
# ---------------------------------------
# FC1's first apply script read its SQL from a fixed worktree path. That
# worktree sat on the PRE-REPAIR branch, PR #145 re-angled 36 duplicate pairs
# and regenerated all three deep seeds, and none of it reached that path. Run
# the old script after the merge and it seeds the UNREPAIRED questions, reports
# success, and the whole repair is lost silently at apply time. A ladder that
# cannot tell it is reading stale SQL is the same class of defect as a gate that
# cannot fail.
#
# So this script never reads a working tree. It resolves each file out of the
# git OBJECT STORE at a ref (origin/main by default) with `git show`, and
# REFUSES unless every file's sha256 matches the digest pinned below.
#
# WHY DIGESTS AND NOT A COMMIT SHA. This repository squash merges, so the
# commits on a branch do not survive into main and a pinned commit sha would be
# wrong the moment the next PR lands. File CONTENT survives a squash unchanged,
# so the content digest is the thing worth pinning. It is also immune to which
# clone, worktree or branch the SQL is fetched from, which is the failure this
# script exists to make impossible. Re-run `verify` against origin/main AFTER
# this PR's squash merge, rather than assuming it, and record the result.
#
# ON A MISMATCH it names exactly which files drifted, prints what it expected
# and what it found, and prints a `pin` command that reprints the whole digest
# table, SO NOBODY EVER HAND-EDITS A DIGEST TO MAKE A RUN PASS.
#
# THE TWO STEPS.
#
#   seed      Step 1. Catalogue row goes in as `coming_soon` at path_order 49,
#             module `commercial_trading`, so no learner can reach any of it.
#             Three tier structures, 78 lesson keys, 396 questions, three
#             capstones with eighteen graded fields (floats, each at its
#             precision class's tolerance; no NPV and no IRR).
#   go-live   Step 2. HELD. `coming_soon` -> `available`, behind the go-live's
#             assertions (shape, a numeric grader at the precision classes, no
#             NPV or IRR, the prompts and the planning period, the digest,
#             derived-figure and pairwise sweeps, the engine, a second route in
#             SQL for every closed-form field, the oracle's exact run for all
#             eighteen and eighteen traps) and a typed confirmation of the
#             upload. It does not need crude (48) or supply (50) seeded or live
#             first.
#
# =========================== THE UPLOAD GATE ================================
# DO NOT RUN `go-live` UNTIL A PRODUCTION UPLOAD CARRIES /dashboard/apps/refinery.
#
# The 78 lessons, the teaching lab (refineryLab.js) and its three explorer
# panels (screen, plan, variance) ship in the ZIP and not in this database.
# This database holds the catalogue row, the lesson KEYS, the questions and the
# capstones. Flip before the upload and a live Commercial & Trading tile points
# at a route that does not exist.
#
# Verify the upload by CHUNK CONTENT and not by hash: serve the built
# DashboardPage chunk and confirm it carries `apps/refinery`. `go-live`
# below will not run until you confirm that in writing.
# ============================================================================
#
# MIGRATIONS.md. This ladder is HELD, so the go-live is logged when it is
# APPLIED and not before. Both steps below tell you exactly what to log and when.
#
# USAGE
#   ./apply_rf_refinery.sh verify        content check only, no database
#   ./apply_rf_refinery.sh seed          step 1
#   ./apply_rf_refinery.sh go-live       step 2, ONLY after the upload
#   ./apply_rf_refinery.sh pin <ref>     reprint the digest table
#
#   REPO=<path>  a git clone or worktree of petrolord-nextgen (any branch). The
#                default is resolved from THIS SCRIPT'S OWN LOCATION when it is
#                running out of the committed tree.
#   REF=<ref>    the ref to resolve the SQL from. Default origin/main.
#   LINKED=<dir> the checkout linked to the NextGen Supabase project, where the
#                SQL is run from. Default the petrolord-nextgen workspace.
#
# EXIT CODES. 0 did the thing. 2 REFUSED. Nothing else returns 0.
# =============================================================================
